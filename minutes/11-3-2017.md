## Meeting Minutes 10-20-2017
Everyone in attendance

### Status:
 - Mux Works
 - Wall sensing works
   - Able to switch between mux channels dynamically and read from all 3 walls sensors
   - 10 us penalty for switching is not much compared to alleged 300us that analogRead() takes
     - Possibly switch off Arduino and use baremetal C?
 - Can navigate a maze with left and right turns! (randomly)
 - Simulator is almost there, needs some touching up

### Todo:
  - Send maze updates in realtime to base station
    - Need to translate between robot's current orientation and the "true north" orientation used by the maze
  - Need to implement DFS on the robot
  - Implement 180 degree turns

### Next Meeting
  - 4pm - 9pm Saturday office hours
    - Basic DFS
    - Try maze updates
