# Lab 4: Radio Communication and Map Drawing
## Objective

# Radio Team:
### Members: Norman, Divya, Wenhan


# FPGA Team:
### Members: Nick, Eric, Julia

## Materials
- FPGA
- 1 Arduino Uno
- 1 VGA cable
- 1 VGA connector
- 1 VGA switch
- Various resistors (for voltage divider)

## Procedure
### Making our grid display the full 4x5 grid
### Receiving packets from the arduino
Using the packet format that you have agreed on with the radio team, write a module to read packets from the Arduino. Use the communication protocol you decided on in the pre-lab. To test your packet receiver, consider using the on-board LEDs and output signals onto GPIO pins and viewing them using a scope.

### Highlight the robot’s current location based on packet information
Now that you can receive packets, parse this data and use it to display the robot’s current location in the 4x5 grid.

### Marking explored territory
Finally, add additional support to display any previously-visited locations.
