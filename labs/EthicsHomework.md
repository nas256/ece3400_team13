On May 7, 2016, Joshua Brown was driving his 2015 Tesla Model S from Cedar Key to Ocala, Florida. The trip lasted 41 minutes, 37 of which the driver relied upon the vehicle’s internal driving assists, principally Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) and Autosteer lane-keeping, despite a combined two minutes of visual and auditory warnings to the driver from the vehicle to provide manual steering input. At 4:36 PM, the Tesla struck a semitrailer that had turned in front of the car’s path, resulting in the car travelling off the highway and striking a utility pole. Brown was killed in the event (NTSB 2016). 

Joshua Brown’s death is contemporaneous with the widespread integration of automation into common consumer products and services, from “self-driving cars” to automated restaurants (Washington Post). Due to the pace of its advancement, however, automation is proving difficult to regulate. According to the National Transportation Safety, vehicular automation in particular has no enforced regulatory guidelines, only a set of recommendations set forth by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA): “[vehicle] manufacturers are not required to follow the vehicle performance guidance in the [Automated Vehicle] Policy, but it provides a framework for operation, testing, and safety assessment of vehicle automation” (NTSB p 32). 

The lack of legally enforced Automated Vehicle (AV) policies has lead to ambiguous notions of proper AV usage, what constitutes sufficient safeguards against AV-related accidents, and the degree to which manufacturers must disclose AV limitations. Owing to the number of stakeholders consciously or unconsciously invested in this issue – AV consumers and manufacturers have direct stakes in the AV market, though all people living in places where AV technology is distributed are affected by safety policies – NHTSA must codify manufacturer disclosures regarding the technical limitations of AV and require AV consumers to read and understand said limitations at the time of purchase, and rigorously define proper usage and establish a standard for AV misuse safeguards. These conclusions are drawn from multiple justice tests. Virtue tests would be less appropriate in this context, since they would directly address the reputation of a body of stakeholders, such as Tesla, Inc., while relegating the safety of the public and AV consumers to secondary importance. 

To determine the fairest future course of future action regarding AV policy making, Tesla Inc.’s AV technical documentation and technology must first be addressed. According to NTSB’s incident report detailing Joshua Brown’s crash, the Brown’s Tesla Model S falls under a Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) automation ranking of 2, which indicates that the car was only partially automated, and that “human driver[s] [must] monitor the driving environment” (NTSB p 24). Though this ranking is not explicitly mentioned in the Tesla Model S manual, the manual does make numerous notices that detail the company’s idea of proper AV usage, including “Warning: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is designed for your driving comfort and convenience and is not a collision warning or avoidance system. It is your responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times” (Tesla p 67). The manual also lists situations in which the Tesla’s AV technology may fail, such as when 

•	The road has sharp curves.
• Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
• Bright light (oncoming headlights or direct sunlight) is interfering with the camera's view.
• The radar sensor is obstructed (dirty, covered, etc.).
• The windshield area in the camera's  eld of view is obstructed (fogged over, dirty, covered by a sticker, etc.).

The manual clearly states the limitations of the car’s technology, and provides multiple disclaimers regarding AV misuse. Whether Joshua Brown read these limitations and disclaimers, however, is unknown, since reading car manuals is typically performed at the car owner’s discretion. If there existed a law to enforce manual reading and comprehension prior to purchase, ignorance of these points would be circumvented. A simple justice test defines car consumers and the general public as principal stakeholders. Presale manual reading and comprehension would benefit the public and AV drivers, since the drivers would, in principle, know how to appropriately use AV technology, thus decreasing the probability of an AV-related road accident. No presale manual reading or comprehension might be convenient for the consumer, but would increase driver negligence and thus increase the risk of an accident. Altogether, legally enforced manual reading and comprehension would promote safe driving at the expense of consumer convenience, which is trivial in comparison. 

It must not be assumed, however, that all manuals appropriately detail safe AV driving practices, or that appropriate AV safeguards are implemented to uphold such practices, since there is no legally enforced definition of what “safe AV driving practices” entails. For example, although Joshua Brown’s Tesla gave Brown multiple auditory and visual warnings against long-term unsupervised driving, the car still allowed him to drive for 37 minutes without feedback (NTSB p 14). A class 2 AV in particular must provide more stringent safeguards against misusing AV technology, such as an automated shut down mode at any speed.

NHTSA must be held accountable for this lack of enforcement. A justice test demonstrates that the codification of safe AV practice and enforcement of AV safe practice safeguards is the fairest course of future action. The principal stakeholders in this case include AV car manufacturers, consumers, and the general public. If safe driving practices and safeguards were codified, manufacturers would be liable for failing to detail proper usage and implementing safeguards based on a universal concept of proper usage, and would be required to invest resources in updating their vehicles’ technology to industry standard, but consumers and the general public would benefit from safer vehicles. Car manufacturers might argue that a mandate enforcing standardization of technical safeguards would result in legal disputes over proprietary safeguard technologies. Additionally, if these legal disputes were settled, standardized safeguards would result in a lack of vehicular and hence brand diversity. The first concern is valid, but manufacturers may recruit third party technology firms such as Robert Bosch GmbH, Valeo SA, or Mando Corporation (http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2016/04/07/autonomous-cars-patents-perspectives/id=68045/) to avoid legal issues. The second concern fails to consider that standardization establishes a quality baseline, not a quality ceiling. Despite costs to car manufacturers and possible legal issues, consumer and public safety are of the utmost importance, and according to an ethical justice test, NHTSA must codify safe AV practice and enforce AV safeguards.

Automation is powerful and pervasive, and may make life safer and more convenient if properly implemented. When automated processes directly affect human safety, stringent policies must be created, and manufacturers must be held accountable for upholding these policies. Given the number of automobile drivers, the proper use and safeguarding of automated vehicles is particularly important, and regulatory bodies such as NHTSA are responsible for ensuring the safety of AV drivers and the general public. Preliminary policies such as legally enforced manual reading and comprehension, thorough technical limitation and appropriate usage disclaimers, and standardized AV misuse safeguards will ease the transition of automated vehicles from a nascent to a mature and safe mode of transportation.
