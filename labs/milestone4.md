# Milestone 4: Putting it All Together

##Introduction
The main goal of milestone 4 was to integrate all the previous labs and milestones into one seamless system. For this milestone, we were tasked with demonstrating that our robot can sucessfully communicate with the basestation and have it display walls and treasures as the robot finds them, and signal "done" on both the screen and the speakers when the robot has finished a maze. With the completion of this milestone, our robot and basestation will essentially be competition ready, and the rest of our time in lab will be spent making performance optimizations on the robot.
