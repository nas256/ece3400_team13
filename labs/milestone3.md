# Milestone 3: Algorithms
### Nicholas Sarkis, Norman Chen, Eric Cole, Julia Currie, Divya Gupta, Wenhan Xia

## In Simulation:
4 points: Working algorithm that facilitates maze exploration.
1 point: Indicator that shows the robot is done (explored everything explorable)

## On Maze:
4 points: Working algorithm that facilitates maze exploration.
1 point: Indicator that shows the robot is done (explored everything explorable)
You donâ€™t have to worry about treasures/microphone circuitry yet, for either the simulation or the real-life maze exploration. You do have to include walls. We do not expect everyone to have a perfectly running system in this milestone, the goal is for everyone to start the implementation and think about (and convey on the website) what next tasks/improvements need to be done to compete in the final competition.
