## Results
We placed in the top 6 for the competition, which we were all very satisied with.

Because we didn't attach a microphone in our robot, we had to have Nick Sarkis press the button on the robot to start it every time.

In round 1, we solved the maze the fastest relative to our round, and only falsely read one treasure.

In round 2, we solved the maze the fastest relative to our round, but we failed to sense a treausre.

In round 3, we falsely sensed a treasure in our first try, but what really hurt us this round was that our robot ran over a stray piece of tape on a 180 turn, which caused us to miss a turn and go off the grid. We completed the maze with no errors on the second try however. Unfortunately, we did not record a video of the second try.
