# Addition of a Printed Control Board

## Motivations

As we continue to add components and parts, our robot gets more and more bulky, and becomes very prone to wires coming loose or other random sources of failure. This has become more difficult to bug check. Because much of our basic design is completed after the labs and milestones, we will address these difficulties by incorporating a printed circuit board (PCB) into our design. A PCB is an insulator panel onto which conductive wires are laminated, allowing connection of different devices without the burden associated with using a breadboard and wires. 

Designing a PCB will allow us to translate our current design into a much more compact format, with a lot of benefits:

1) Our robot's structure will be a lot smaller and simpler. We will not need to worry about wires coming loose while working, and adding or removing components for future modifications will become much easier when our design is much less bulky.

2) Our robot will become lighter, increasing speed and efficiency during the competition. 

3) A PCB will make our robot more effective by reducing circuit noise.

4) Our final robot design will look much cleaner.
