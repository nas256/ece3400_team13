# Servos and Isolators
Throughout our testing, we realized that the behavior of our sensors was sometimes inconsistent, which we attributed to the servos being connected to the same voltage source as the sensors. In order to alleviate this problem, we added an optoisolator between the servos and the arduino so that the voltage changes in the servos do not affect the behavior of our line and wall sensors.
